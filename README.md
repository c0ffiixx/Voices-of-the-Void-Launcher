# Voices of the Void Launcher
A specialised launcher used for launching the game Voices of the Void (https://mrdrnose.itch.io/votv)

I am not experienced at all, I am new to programming especially in Python. If the launchers cause any problems please reach out to me and/or commit a fix to the project. Thank you for understanding.

## What does this do?
I got sick and tired of deleting and downloading gigabytes of data just to play the new version of the game, with this program I am *hoping* that I can make use of a virtual file system and an efficient file downloader to make the process easier, faster and automatic. With mod compatability in the future.
